# Full Stack Starter Pack

Made during April 2021, during Hack Days at Root Inc.

### Purpose: 
Get started quickly on projects in the future. 

### Description: 
Setting up login and registration routes can take a lot of time and it's such a small part of your app. I've found myself many times with an idea, and then quickly bogged down by the start-up friction. The idea here is a fork-ready repo for bootstrapping full stack web projects in the future. 

### The Stack
- Ruby on Rails API/backend
- Postgres for the database
- Rspec for server side testing
- Bycrypt for handling user/password security
- RackCors for managing cross origin requests
- active model serializers to serialize active record objects

- Vue.js for the view/frontend
- Bootstrap for easy reactive styling
- Vuex for managing frontend state
- Vue route for manager routing for a single page web application

This full stack starter pack is designed to give the bare bones full stack application, but with examples to quickly build it out. 
- Login/Registration is completely built in.
- Several examples for setting up the tables and routes on the backend and fetching data from rails api on the frontend.
- Several examples of using vuex actions, getters, and mutations
- Lightweight. Not much boilerplate for deletion.

Soon to come, a video walkthrough tutorial and a blog post tutorial.
